# ðŸšœ The Plow

An efficient Chia Plot mover.

Uses `inotify` to watch for new Chia plots and then fires off `rsync` to move
them to their final destination.

It can do many in parallel, one at a time, one per source, or one per destination.

## Known Issues

- We currently depend on `aionotify`, which is broken on python3.11+. See issue#9 for more information.
